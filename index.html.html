In Maths or Geometry, a circle is a special kind of ellipse in which the eccentricity is zero and the two foci are coincident. A circle is also termed as the locus of the points drawn at an equidistant from the centre. The distance from the centre of the circle to the outer line is its radius. Diameter is the line which divides the circle into two equal parts and is also equal to twice of the radius.<BR><BR>

A circle is a basic 2D shape which is measured in terms of its radius. The circles divide the plane into two regions such as interior and exterior region. It is similar to the type of line segment. Imagine that the line segment is bent around till its ends join. Arrange the loop until it is precisely circular.<br><BR>

The circle is a two-dimensional figure, which has its area and perimeter. The perimeter of the circle is also called the circumference, which is the distance around the circle. The area of the circle is the region bounded by it in a 2D plane. <B>RUDRAKSH RAJVANSHI</B> <BR><BR>
